Network Security Projects Overview (Windows & Linux)
This File contains documentation and configurations for securing and monitoring Windows and Linux server environments using industry-standard tools and techniques. The focus is on enhancing system integrity, detecting malicious behavior, and enforcing firewall rules for secure access control.

üîê 1. Vulnerabilities and Recommendation Report (Windows & Linux)
Identified critical, high, and medium vulnerabilities on both Windows Server 2016 and Ubuntu Linux.

Provided tailored mitigation recommendations such as enabling automatic updates, disabling unused services, and applying least privilege access controls.

üõ°Ô∏è 2. Firewall Configurations ‚Äì Palo Alto (Linux Environment Focus)
* Configured trusted, untrusted, and DMZ zones with interface segmentation.
* Applied NAT and security policies to control inbound/outbound traffic.
* Implemented threat prevention features: URL filtering, antivirus, DNS Sinkhole, and WildFire integration.
* Verified blocking of malicious content (e.g., Eicar test) and enforced controlled access to services via FTP/SSH.

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Network Security Monitoring ‚Äì Unauthorized Cryptocurrency Mining Detection (Linux Focus)
* Simulated cryptojacking activity and monitored network traffic using tools like Wireshark and Splunk.
* Developed alerts for abnormal CPU/network activity and unauthorized DNS queries.
* Recommended steps to isolate and mitigate compromised systems.
